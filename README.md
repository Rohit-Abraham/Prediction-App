This Shiny application is part of the Developing Data Products Coursera course project. The objective is to predict an iris flower species using a prediction model trained on the 'iris' dataset. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

This interactive app allows the user to select any value for the predictors and using that the app gives out the probability-based prediction of the species it most likely is.
